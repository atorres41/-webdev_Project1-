    <h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>

    <p1>Video games have been apart of my life since I was a kid. I had started out with many of the classics, such as Angry Birds
        and Doodle Jump on the early versions of the iPod. Additionally, I had access to a variety of older games from my dad's 
        Nintendo cartirdge console, such as the original Super Mario Bros. I was fascinated by the hours spent playing these games, 
        and I had always wanted to explore more games as I got older. As I grew up, I was able to get my own gaming console, such as 
        a Nintendo WiiU and a Nintendo Switch. Even as times have changed, I enjoy the time having spent with the classics, and I'm 
        curious what the future holds for gaming.

        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
        <img class="imageR" src="hollowKnightResize.jpg" alt="Hollow_Knight">
        <p>Hollow Knight is a 2D action-adventure game created by Team Cherry, a small indie dev team consisting of three people.
            It's a game where you play as a silent bug knight that explores the ruins of a fallen kingdom called Hallownest.
            The game can be described as a metrovania, where you explore interconnected areas, fight bosses, and gain new abilities to 
            progress further. It has amazing handdrawn art and a beautiful soundtrack that adds to the immersion of the fallen world.
            I found myself picking up the game around two years ago, and it was my first introduction into the type of game that it was.
            The lore and story behind the game was massive, and it wasn't until after I picked it back up earlier this year that I was able
            piece the story together bit by bit as I progressed further and gained access to more abilities and lands. I still have yet to
            complete the game in its entirety, but I'm taking my time with it and enjoying the experience it has to offer.

        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
        <img class="imageR" src="botwImage.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild">
        <p>The Legend of Zelda is one of the more recent Zelda games, despite it's release date being back in 2017, the same
            as Hollow Knight. I picked this game up early on, as I enjoyed the franchise and it seemed like a promising and 
            grand game to play. The game is set in a massive open world, where you play as Link as he awakens from what we later 
            learn to be a hundred year slumber. He comes across a world that had been devasted by a calamity known as Ganon, who had
            taken over the kingdom of Hyrule. Playing as Link, we use the world around us to our advantage, using weapons, 
            food, and unlocked abilities to explore and learn more about the past. It's a beautifully crafted game, one with plenty
            hours of playability with its many secrets, sidequests, and shrines to discover. It's definitely one of my 
            longest played games, and I still have yet to play the sequel.

        <li>Super Smash Bros</li>
        <img class="imageR" src="SSBImage.jpg" alt="Super Smash Bros">
        <p>Super Smash Bros was a game I was given along with my WiiU back when I was a kid. It consisted of gameplay through the 
            fighting of numerous characters across many different franchises, such as Nintendo, Sega, and Capcom, Konami, and many
            more. It was a game that I had spent hours playing with my family and friends, and it was one of the first games that
            I had played competitively. I remember playing with my dad for hours on end, alwasy trying to get improve and learn
            the movesets of more and more characters. I've had many great times playing this game with family and friends, and I
            will always hold those memories close and dear to my heart.

        <li>Dead By Daylight</li>
        <img class="imageR" src="dbdImage.jpg" alt="Dead By Daylight">
        <p>Dead By Daylight is a game consisting of gameplay between four survivors and a killer, both side seeing many familiar faces
            from various franchises, such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Halloween. The goal of the survivors is to work together to 
            repair generators around the map, while the killer's goal is to hunt down and sacrifice the survivors to an entity. I picked up this game
            around two years ago, and it's been a game that I've been able to use to connect with others and have a platform to play together
            and have a good time. I still feel very new to the game, as I take breaks from it every now and again, but I've recently picked
            it back up again and have enjoyed playing with new faces. 
        </p>
      </ul>


    <p>Even as times have changed and the gaming industry doesn't hold the same amount of joy and nostalgia as it once did, I enjoy
    the time having spent with the classics and the memories gained from them. I'm curious what the future of gaming holds, and
    what we can look forward to as the technology changes, improves, and adapts to modern times.</p>
