    <h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>

    <p1>Video games have been apart of my life since I was a kid. I had started out with many of the classics, such as Angry Birds
        and Doodle Jump on the early versions of the iPod. Additionally, I had access to a variety of older games from my dad's 
        Nintendo cartirdge console, such as the original Super Mario Bros. I was fascinated by the hours spent playing these games, 
        and I had always wanted to explore more games as I got older. As I grew up, I was able to get my own gaming console, such as 
        a Nintendo WiiU and a Nintendo Switch. Even as times have changed, I enjoy the time having spent with the classics, and I'm 
        curious what the future holds for gaming.

        <p>Hollow Knight is a 2D action-adventure game created by Team Cherry, a small indie dev team consisting of three people.
            It's a game where you play as a silent bug knight that explores the ruins of a fallen kingdom called Hallownest.
            The game can be described as a metrovania, where you explore interconnected areas, fight bosses, and gain new abilities to 
            progress further. It has amazing handdrawn art and a beautiful soundtrack that adds to the immersion of the fallen world.
            I found myself picking up the game around two years ago, and it was my first introduction into the type of game that it was.
            The lore and story behind the game was massive, and it wasn't until after I picked it back up earlier this year that I was able
            piece the story together bit by bit as I progressed further and gained access to more abilities and lands. I still have yet to
            complete the game in its entirety, but I'm taking my time with it and enjoying the experience it has to offer.
