    <h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>

    <p1>Video games have been apart of my life since I was a kid. I had started out with many of the classics, such as Angry Birds
        and Doodle Jump on the early versions of the iPod. Additionally, I had access to a variety of older games from my dad's 
        Nintendo cartirdge console, such as the original Super Mario Bros. I was fascinated by the hours spent playing these games, 
        and I had always wanted to explore more games as I got older. As I grew up, I was able to get my own gaming console, such as 
        a Nintendo WiiU and a Nintendo Switch. Even as times have changed, I enjoy the time having spent with the classics, and I'm 
        curious what the future holds for gaming.
