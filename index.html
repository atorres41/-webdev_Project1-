    <h3>More About Me:</h3>
    <p>Before college, I attended John Hancock College Prep in Chicago, Illinois 
    and graduated 2023. I was able to learn my engineering related skills such as 
    having an introduction into AutoCAD(3d modeling software) and learning the 
    basics of teamwork engineering through collaborative projects such as drafting and 
    creating a working claw machine. I was also able to take AP classes such as AP 
    Computer Science A and AP Calculus AB.

    <p>I was a member of Boy Scouts organizations since I was 7. I've learned many new skills from it, such as how to lead, camping outdoors, and many volunterring service oppurtunities. 
    Once a year, I would go to a summer camp for a week with my troop and other scouts from around the country. We would set up our own tents, cook our own food, and do many activities such as hiking, swimming, and cooking.

    <p>I grew up with my parents and my younger sister. We used to have a giant backyard 
    jungle gym that I used to spend hours on. We used it all throughout the year, building snow
    forts in the winter and water slides in the summer. It was a fun way that I had stayed active as a kid.</p1>
    </p>
    <p>I've worked with a company called At Your Service for the past year. Most of my days working with them
    involve me aiding in providing guest servies for numerous events for two staduims in Chicago. Usually,
    these events are for concerts and sports games for basketball, baseball, and hockey. I enjoy 
    the job and the opportunities it has provided me. I've been able to meet many new people, 
    experience exciting events that I would have otherwise not known about, and been able to share
    my experiences with my friends and family.
